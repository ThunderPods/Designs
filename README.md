# about ThunderPods
ThunderPods were created to maximise the utility and versitility of space within vans and other large vehicles. Whether you are planning to use that vehicle for food preperation, camping, commercial, trade or any other application, ThunderPods allow you to reconfigure your space in new and useful ways as your needs change.

# how ThunderPods works
The system is built using some key component types. These are:

- A base plate - ThunderBoard
- Box elements - ThunderPods. and:
- Finishing and fairing components.

## the ThunderBoard
The ThunderBoard is the base of the system and sits directly on the floor of your vehicle. You can modify the standard board or select from the library of ThunderBoards provided. The thunderboard is fixed into the base of the vehicle permanently. This provides the restraint and locating for the ThunderPod modules that are inserted ontop.

*NB: The board sits flat on the ground and normal cargo can be placed on top of it directly.*

## the ThunderPod
ThunderPods leverage modularity to create a variety of 'primative' components that can be manipulated to almost any specific need.

The ThunderPod primative units have locking tabs at the base that are inserted into the ThunderBoard or below ThunderPods.

## fairings
Fairings are available to fill spaces between the walls of the van and the ThunderPods system.

# Naming

## Sizing
The ThunderPods system is design around a key unit dimension of **360mm**. Different sizes are available and are designated using a standard sizing system:
**HEIGHT x WIDTH x DEPTH **

*ie: a standard minimum unit of 360 x 360 x 360mm will be called: "1x1x1"*
and for example a unit 1 unit tall, 2 units wide and 2 units deep would be called: **1x2x2** 

## Naming Designations 
Names are given based on the the construction of the pod, these are abreviated to two letter identifiers for convenience. An example of the naming is below:

-BX - Box  
-DR - Drawer  
-TD - Trap door  
-OS - Open Shelving  
-TB - Table top  
-CB - Cabinet
